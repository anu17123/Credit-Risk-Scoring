- **Machine Learning** — XGBoost classifier for prediction
- **Preprocessing** — Scikit-learn for scaling and transformation
- **Dashboard** — Streamlit for interactive UI
- **Visualizations** — Dynamic charts to display feature impacts and prediction probabilities

**Key Inputs:**
- Loan Amount
- Annual Income
- Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
